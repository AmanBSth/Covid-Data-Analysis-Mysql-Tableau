# Covid Data Analysis

This repository includes a series of SQL queries that were executed on COVID-19 data, with a focus on understanding the impact of the pandemic on different regions and populations. The queries cover a range of analyses, including calculating death percentages, infection rates, vaccination statistics, and visualizing data by continent. Additionally, a view was created to store data for potential future visualizations. These SQL queries are aimed at providing insights into the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on different countries and continents, with a particular emphasis on death counts, vaccination rates, and population-level analysis. The results from these queries can serve as valuable inputs for further data visualization and reporting.

# Data Visualization in Tableau

In addition to the SQL data analysis, a comprehensive data visualization of the COVID-19 dataset has been created using Tableau. This visualization provides an interactive and visual representation of key insights and trends in the data.

The Tableau dashboard offers a user-friendly way to visualize and interact with the data, enabling you to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and populations. It complements the SQL data analysis and provides a more intuitive way to explore and interpret the data.

Feel free to explore the Tableau dashboard and leverage the SQL analysis results for a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects worldwide.
